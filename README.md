# MATH36032-Project-Two
Code for MATH36032 coursework two

This repositry contains the submitted files for the second project of the course MATH36032. These three files are 'Project_Two(1).pdf', 'foxrabchase1.m' and 'foxrabchase3.m'. 

The aim of project two was to simulate a fox-rabbit chase, and considering two different situations, find whether the fox caught the rabbit. 'foxrabchase1' considers a scenario in which the rabbit runs in a straight diagonal line and the fox chases it with the fox's direction always pointing in the direction of the rabbit. In the scenario of 'foxrabchase3' the speeds of the rabbit and fox decrease with distance travelled. In both scenarios there is a warehouse which may block the fox from seeing the rabbit and instructions on what to code when this situation happens. I was not able to solve either problem whilst considering the warehouse. I was able to successfully solve the first scenario without the warehouse present but not the second.

In 'Project_Two(1).pdf', I discuss the probelms and my solutions to them. The report was created in Latex.
